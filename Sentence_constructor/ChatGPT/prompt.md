        **Possible sentence structure:**
        - Sentence 1: [Location][Subject]？
        - Sentence 2: [Object][Verb]？

        **Suggested next steps:**
        - Try to create the sentence using the vocabulary and structure above.
        - Consider the correct verb form for past tense in Sentence 2.
        - Think about the correct particle usage for location and subject in Sentence 1.
        - Consider using a conjunction to connect the two sentences for full meaning.

        **What to do:**
        - Attempt your own transcription. I’ll help with clues and corrections!
        - Use the vocabulary table to find the right words.
        - Pay attention to sentence structure and particle usage.
        - If you’re unsure about a word or grammar point, ask for a hint.
        - Try connecting both ideas into one sentence for a natural flow.
        - Review your sentence for correct verb conjugation and word order.
