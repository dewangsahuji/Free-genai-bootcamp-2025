    -Bad : the beginner sentene is uncessary , should just start showing the vocablury table 
    -Bad : the sentence structure saya to much , we really want something that is conceptual like this -[location][subject][verb][object][verb-past]?

    Let's work on transcribing the sentence into Japanese. Here's a table of vocabulary to get you started:
    |Japanese |	Romaji	 | English
    |熊	    |   kuma   | bear
    |ドア	   |  doa	  |door
    |ごみ	   |  gomi	  |garbage
    |出す     |  dasu	  |to take out
    |忘れる   | wasureru |to forget
    Possible sentence structure:
    Sentence 1: [Subject]はドアにいますか？ (Are [subject] at the door?)
    Sentence 2: ごみを出すの (Did you take out the garbage?)
    Your turn! Try to create the sentence using the vocabulary and sentence structure. Don't worry if it's not perfect – we can work through it together.
    If you need help or clues, feel free to ask!
