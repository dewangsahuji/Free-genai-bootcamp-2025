        Considerations:

            Use the correct verb form for the past tense in Sentence 2.
            Think about the correct particle usage for the location and subject in Sentence 1.
            Consider using a conjunction to connect the two sentences.

        Next Steps:

            Attempt to create the sentence and I'll guide you through any corrections or adjustments.
